The purpose of this repository is to create a custom version of the containers of the STL anf their methods written in C++. I want to develop this custom library by reading the STL containers specifications and implement their methods taking into account the nature of the different containers.

In this way I hope to refresh my knowledge of the library, improve my C++ knowledge and strenghten my coding skills other than refresh my algorithms and data structures knowledge.
